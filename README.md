Found here are an assortment of Guides and Tools I have released. The Guides used to be scattered around as .pdf's on google drive first, before I put them on other sites. So I made this page in order to have them all in one central place, instead of just those .pdf's.

## Guides
* [How to Atlas Everything in your World (literally, using Blender)](https://maebbie.github.io/UV-Atlas-Everything-Guide-Blender)
<br>An in-depth Guide on how to UV map textures, so they can all fit on a single atlassed texture. This allows scenes to only require 1 Material.

* [How to swap out Baked Lightmaps for Day&Night mode)](https://maebbie.github.io/Swap-Baked-Lightmaps-VRChat)
<br>A solution to have different sets of Baked Lightmaps to work without any need for Unity scripts. Mostly helpful with more restrictive platforms that use Unity.

* [World Thumbnail/World Image Guide including a Template](https://maebbie.github.io/World-Thumbnail-Guide-VRChat)
<br>A downloadable image template with Guidelines to align a Thumbnail for a VRChat World 

## Tools
* [Udon Graph Triggers](https://github.com/Maebbie/Udon-Graph-Triggers)
<br>50+ Dependency-Free Udon Behaviours for VRChat Worlds. Only the VRChat SDK is needed to use these! 

* [BlenderWASD Blender Config](https://github.com/Maebbie/BlenderWASD)
<br>Blender Config designed for large scenes. Adds WASD movement and a custom layout with on point workspaces.
