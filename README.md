Found here are an assortment of Guides and Tools I have released. The Guides used to be scattered around as .pdf's on google drive first, before I put them on other sites. So I made this page in order to have them all in one central place, instead of just those .pdf's.

<br>An in-depth Guide on how to UV map textures, so they can all fit on a single atlassed texture. This allows scenes to only require 1 Material.

<br>A solution to have different sets of Baked Lightmaps to work without any need for Unity scripts. Mostly helpful with more restrictive platforms that use Unity.
